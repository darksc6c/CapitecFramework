    //DATA DRIVEN TESTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    //Data driven testing seperates test logic from test data, allow us to run the same test with different input data sets. This reduce code cuplication and improves test coverage.

    



































    Let's define JSON. What is JSON?
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
    JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
    JSON is easy to read and write.
    JSON is easy to parse and generate.
    JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data interchange language.
